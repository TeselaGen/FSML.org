# Software

FSML.org codebase is architected in a modular and extensible fashion and a number of these modular packages form its foundation. By breaking functionality into smaller packages, these get easier to test, divide up development tasks and reduce techincal debt. The packages are combined into a single cross platform SDK Library, which can be consumed by a variety of clients.
