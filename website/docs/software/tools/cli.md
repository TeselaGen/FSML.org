# Command Line Interface

The FSML CLI tool is one of the FSML implemented client programs that interact with the FSML SDK Library. Its Application Programming Interface (API) provides access to the core FSML funcionalities and basic operations for working with FSML manifest files.

The CLI itself comes with documentation on all the available commands and what they are used for. Essentially the CLI reads and writes FSML manifest files, parses experimental data and allows the installation of either properietary or community-implemented plugins that follow the [Plugin Framework](../../plugins) interface.
