# Tools

FSML.org codebase is architected in a modular and extensible fashion and a number of these modular packages form its foundation. By breaking functionality into smaller packages, these get easier to test, divide up development tasks and reduce techincal debt. The packages are combined into a single cross platform SDK Library, which can be consumed by a variety of clients.

The **FSML Tools** are different client applications that connect to the FSML SDK by levearging its extensibility and modularity. As client-based tools, they all provide access to the same set of core functionalities. Their core differentiator factor is the user experience they offer. And these are intended to cover the different use cases and expertise of its users.
