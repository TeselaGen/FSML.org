# Data Schema

The FSML data schema allows for protocol experiment data to be structured in a well-defined and machine readable format.

Data can be stored in different formats and with different degrees of completeness, the lowest being a reference to one or many data files
containing the experimental information, while the highest attainable by reading, parsing and explaining the data extracted from such files.
This degree of completeness is accounted for in the Utility Score of described in [Core Sections](../../core-sections.md).

- [Tabular](./tabular-data)
